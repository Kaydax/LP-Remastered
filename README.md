# Loud and Proud Remastered
Loud and Proud remastered is a modern version of the Loud and Proud soundfont, using the real original samples instead of using the samples provided by multiplayer piano.

The unprocessed samples are provided by [The Giant](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/keys/the-giant/)

There are two presets in this release:
- Axley Presets
- Kaydax Presets

You can choose what preset you would like to use depending on your taste. Axley presets are more flat sounding while Kaydax presets are made to have a harsher effect with added reverb and chorus
